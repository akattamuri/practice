            It should be like this
            git add files.html (if you have any files)
            git -am 'commit message goes here'
            git push origin master - push changes to master
            
            git init - intialize a new rep with git
            git remote add origin https://github.com/akattamuri/testnjs.git
            git checkout -b branchname - to create and switch to a branch
            git push origin branchname - to push a branch
